### Github Repository 

This webpage and the project list below are hosted in a [github repository](https://github.com/jmhulbert/fhcs). 

Anyone is welcome to collaborate to add or make changes to the [github repository (https://github.com/jmhulbert/fhcs)](https://github.com/jmhulbert/fhcs). The content on this page is compiled using R Markdown, but the project list is maintained as a [.csv file](https://github.com/jmhulbert/fhcs/blob/7abe537b37548a2aa3f0cffe2a85c6763f559be1/files/data/ProjectList.csv).

Note that you need a github account to collaborate or make changes. Feel free to contact <ForestHealthCitSci@gmail.com> for additional details or instructions. 

* As a respository collaborator:
    + You are welcome to clone the repository to your system and work from the R Project (*fhcs.Rproj*) file in Rstudio or you can make changes to the *ProjectList.csv* file. 
    + You can also make changes directly to the .csv file through your browser.
    + Or you can make changes by downloading the .csv file, altering, commiting and pushing it back to the repository.

*Note that the Markdown (index.Rmd) file will need to be knit before the changes will be visible on this webpage.*

## List of Forest Health Citizen Science Projects

> **Have a project to add to this list?** *Share it with the community (ForestHealthCitSci@groups.io), add it to the [.csv file](https://github.com/jmhulbert/fhcs/blob/7abe537b37548a2aa3f0cffe2a85c6763f559be1/files/data/ProjectList.csv), or email the details to <ForestHealthCitSci@gmail.com>.* 

```{r echo=FALSE}
ProjectList <- read.csv("./files/data/ProjectList.csv")
```

The projects below are listed alphabetically. There are currently `r length(ProjectList$Project)` projects listed below. Email <ForestHealthCitSci@gmail.com> for corrections.
```{r echo=FALSE}
kable(ProjectList,align="c") %>% kable_styling(c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive",full_width=F)) %>% scroll_box(width = "95%", height = "700px") #valign?
```

You can cite this table as: Hulbert J, Barton M, Castagneyrol B, Oraizo C,  Rosemartin A. `r format(Sys.Date(), "%Y")`. “Forest Health Citizen Science Project List” FHCS. Commit ID:`r str_trunc(as.data.frame(last_commit(repo))[[1]],6,ellipsis ="")`,  https://github.com/jmhulbert/fhcs. Updated: `r format(Sys.Date(), "%B %e, %Y")`.

```{r include=FALSE}
commits(repo)[[1]]
last_commit(repo)
as.data.frame(last_commit(repo))
str_trunc(as.data.frame(last_commit(repo))[[1]],6,ellipsis = "")
```

Currently the individuals who shared projects in the Google form are listed as authors. Anyone is welcome to add to the project list or be included in the citation. Collaborators in the [github repository](https://github.com/jmhulbert/fhcs) will also be added to the citation.
