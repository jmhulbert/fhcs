## List of Forest Health Citizen Science Projects

> **Have a project to add to this list?** *Share it with the community (ForestHealthCitSci@groups.io), add it to the [.csv file](https://github.com/jmhulbert/fhcs/blob/7abe537b37548a2aa3f0cffe2a85c6763f559be1/files/data/ProjectList.csv), or email the details to <ForestHealthCitSci@gmail.com>.* 

```{r echo=FALSE}
ProjectList <- read.csv("./files/data/ProjectList.csv")
```

The projects below are listed alphabetically. There are currently `r length(ProjectList$Project)` projects listed below. Email <ForestHealthCitSci@gmail.com> for corrections.
```{r echo=FALSE}
kable(ProjectList,align="c") %>% kable_styling(c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive",full_width=F)) %>% scroll_box(width = "95%", height = "700px") #valign?
```

You can cite this table as: Hulbert J, Barton M, Castagneyrol B, Oraizo C,  Rosemartin A. `r format(Sys.Date(), "%Y")`. “Forest Health Citizen Science Project List” FHCS. Commit ID:`r str_trunc(as.data.frame(last_commit(repo))[[1]],6,ellipsis ="")`,  https://github.com/jmhulbert/fhcs. Updated: `r format(Sys.Date(), "%B %e, %Y")`

```{r include=FALSE}
commits(repo)[[1]]
last_commit(repo)
as.data.frame(last_commit(repo))
str_trunc(as.data.frame(last_commit(repo))[[1]],6,ellipsis = "")
```

Currently the individuals who shared projects in the Google form are listed as authors. Anyone is welcome to add to the project list or be included in the citation. Collaborators in the [github repository](#github-repository) will also be added to the citation.
